# 🧠 Focus AI — Task Scheduling RL Environment

> A real-world reinforcement learning environment where an AI agent manages tasks, deadlines, and energy to maximize productivity while avoiding burnout.

---

## 1. Project Overview

Focus AI is an **OpenEnv-compatible RL environment** where an agent must:

- Complete tasks before their deadlines
- Manage energy levels to avoid burnout
- Prioritize high-importance work
- Recover efficiently when exhausted

The environment simulates a real knowledge-worker's day — a domain with genuine utility for agent benchmarking and policy evaluation.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Knowledge workers constantly balance urgent tasks, deadlines, context switching, and cognitive fatigue. This project models that decision process as a structured environment where every action affects future productivity and wellbeing.

---

## 3. Environment Design

### Action Space

String-based actions passed as plain text:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `start_task('<id>')` | Work on a task (costs time + energy) |
| `take_break(<hours>)` | Rest to recover energy (costs time) |
| `switch_task('<id>')` | Change current focus (0.5h overhead) |
| `noop()` | Do nothing (penalized -3) |

### Observation Space

Typed Pydantic `Observation` model returned from `reset()` and `step()`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | float | Current hour (starts at 9, ends at 24) |
| `energy` | int | Energy level 0–100 |
| `energy_level` | str | `low` (≤40) / `medium` (41–70) / `high` (>70) |
| `tasks` | List[Task] | All tasks with status |
| `current_task` | str \| None | Active task id |
| `recent_actions` | List[str] | Last 3 actions taken |
| `goal` | str | Episode objective |
| `legal_actions` | List[str] | Valid actions at this state |

---

## 4. Reward Function

Reward is calculated per step and clamped to `[-20, +20]`.

| Condition | Reward |
|---|---|
| Complete high-priority task | +15 base (+2 priority bonus) |
| Complete medium-priority task | +12 base |
| Complete low-priority task | +10 base (-2 priority penalty) |
| Finish before deadline | +7 total (+5 deadline + +2 early) |
| Miss deadline | -10 |
| Work at high energy | +3 |
| Work at medium energy | +1 |
| Work at low energy | -11 (-8 delta -3 extra) |
| Smart break at low energy | +7 (+5 delta +2 extra) |
| Unnecessary break at high energy | -3 |
| `noop()` | -3 |
| Invalid action | -3 (flat) |
| Burnout (energy ≤ 0) | -10 on top of step reward |

---

## 5. Task Difficulty Levels

### 🟢 Easy
- 2 tasks, high starting energy (80/100)
- `report` (high priority, deadline 12h, 1h) + `inbox` (low, 18h, 1h)

### 🟡 Medium
- 3 tasks, medium energy (60/100)
- `pr_review` (high, 11h, 2h) + `client_call` (medium, 14h, 2h) + `docs` (low, 18h, 1h)

### 🔴 Hard
- 6 tasks, medium-low energy (55/100)
- 2 critical blockers + 4 mixed-priority tasks
- Requires genuine multi-step planning

---

## 6. Scoring System

Each difficulty has a deterministic grader. Raw scores are mapped to **strictly inside (0, 1)** via `safe_score()`:

```
safe_score(raw) = 0.01 + 0.98 × raw,    raw ∈ [0, 1]
```

- **Minimum possible score**: 0.01 (nothing done)
- **Maximum possible score**: 0.99 (perfect episode)
- **Never 0.0 or 1.0** — guaranteed by linear mapping + runtime assertion

| Grader | Weights |
|---|---|
| `grade_easy` | 60% completion + 40% on-time |
| `grade_medium` | 40% completion + 35% on-time + 25% energy efficiency |
| `grade_hard` | 35% completion + 30% on-time + 20% energy + 15% priority quality |

---

## 7. Episode Termination

An episode ends when ANY of these is true:

1. All tasks completed
2. Energy reaches 0 (burnout)
3. Time reaches 24h (end of day)
4. 5 consecutive invalid or noop steps (stagnation guard)
